# PhD Dissertation #

The work is also included in my doctoral dissertation. Chapter 4 is about the ranker module and Chapter 5 is about the reader module. In Chapter 5, we also apply our latest __TranSync__ technique to the book QA task and push forward the SOTA performance by about 2 points (see Table 5.6).
